# cloud-itonami-isco-8189

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 8189**: Stationary Plant and Machine Operators Not Elsewhere Classified.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent stationary plant operator: a plant-monitoring robot performs gauge reading and sampling near operating equipment under a governor-gated actor, so the operator keeps their own process and safety records instead of renting a closed plant-control SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a plant-monitoring robot performs gauge reading, temperature sensing and sample collection near operating equipment under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Stationary Plant Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
operating near pressurized systems, or during startup/shutdown sequences) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
production order + operating procedure + safety envelope
        |
        v
Plant Operations Advisor -> Stationary Plant Governor -> operate/monitor, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.
